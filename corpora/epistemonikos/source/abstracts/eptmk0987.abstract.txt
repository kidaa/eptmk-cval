CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that consuming a diet containing polyunsaturated fatty acids instead of saturated fatty acid reduced coronary heart disease events. The search strategy may have excluded relevant studies, data came from older studies (1968 to 1992) and quality appeared generally low. The conclusions should be treated with caution.
