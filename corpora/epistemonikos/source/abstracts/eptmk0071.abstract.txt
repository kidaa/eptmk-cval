CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the primary prophylaxis, and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis, with low molecular weight heparins was safe and effective in children aged 18 years and under. The unknown quality of the included studies and methodological flaws means the authors conclusions may not be reliable and are not entirely consistent with the results.
