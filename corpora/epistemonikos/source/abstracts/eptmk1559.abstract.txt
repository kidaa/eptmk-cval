The effect of Aloe vera juice in combination with glibenclamide was investigated in diabetic patients. There was no response to glibenclamide alone but Aloe vera juice significantly reduced levels of fasting blood glucose within two weeks and of triglycerides within four weeks. It showed no effect on cholesterol levels and had no toxic effects on kidney or liver function as assessed by blood chemistry. The results support the use of Aloe vera in the treatment of diabetes.
