CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was associated with small but significant improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with acute myocardial infarction at 3 to 12 months' follow-up. The treatment was generally well tolerated in these patients. This was a generally well-conducted review, but the reliability of the authors' conclusions remains unclear given the differences between the studies.
