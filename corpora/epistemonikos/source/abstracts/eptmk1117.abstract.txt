CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) TKIs (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and single-agent chemotherapy had low response rates in treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer for patients with poor performance status. EGFR TKIs tended to more effective disease control and had lower toxicity. Quality and process limitations make the reliability of the conclusions unclear.
