CRD SUMMARY: This review found that adjunctive mechanical devices are safe and associated with better perfusion and decreased embolisation in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Although these conclusions are likely to be reliable, they should be interpreted with some degree of caution as the validity of the primary studies was not assessed and details of the control interventions were not reported.
