CRD SUMMARY: The authors concluded that compared to no surgery, bariatric surgery (both gastric banding and gastric by-pass) reduced the risk of global mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular mortality in obese patients. This was a generally well-conducted review, but the low quality and variability of the evidence suggests the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution.
