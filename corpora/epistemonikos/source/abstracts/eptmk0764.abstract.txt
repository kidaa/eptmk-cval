CRD SUMMARY: This review determined overall CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses to canarypox vector-based human immunodeficiency virus vaccines. The authors concluded that further studies are required to identify the dose or immunisation schedule to maximise CTL response. Insufficient details of the review methods and the restriction to English language publications make it difficult to comment on the strength of the evidence underpinning the authors' conclusions.
