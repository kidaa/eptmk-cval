CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that dopamine agonists, including ropinirole, exhibited a higher incidence of adverse effects than placebo. Ropinirole had a similar profile to other dopamine agonists in terms of adverse events. The level of clinical heterogeneity, reliance on indirect comparisons and the relatively limited search mean that some caution is required in interpreting the conclusions.
