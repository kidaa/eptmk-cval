CRD SUMMARY: This review set out to evaluate continuous passive motion (CPM) after total knee arthroplasty in terms of range of motion. The authors concluded that there was moderate, conflicting evidence of a positive, short-term effect of adding CPM to standardised physiotherapy, but no long-term effects. The conclusion appears appropriate, but potential selection bias and the omission of data may weaken this conclusion.
