CRD SUMMARY: This review assessed the effects of antioxidant vitamins on mortality and cancer incidence. The authors concluded that supplements containing beta-carotene are harmful in smokers and others at high risk for lung cancer, but appear to have no effect in the general population. This was a generally well-conducted review and the authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable.
