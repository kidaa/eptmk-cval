Polyglycolic acid (PGA) sutures and traditional catgut were compared in 190 patients undergoing episiotomy. Each group was also randomly allocated to a double blind comparison of therapy with oral proteolytic enzymes (Chymoral) and placebo. The combination of Chymoral and polyglycolic acid sutures was shown to reduce the level of pain, assessed subjectively, and there was a significant reduction in analgesic requirements in the Chymoral/PGA group.
