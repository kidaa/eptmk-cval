CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that the evidence supported use of liquid-based cytology or conventional cytology for cervical cancer screening. More complete evidence is required before human papillomavirus-enhanced primary screening was widely adopted in women aged 30 years or older. These conclusions are likely to be reliable, although potential for language bias should be borne in mind.
