CRD SUMMARY: The review concluded that BTX-A may be a treatment option for urinary incontinence in patients with MS or SCI; adverse events limited the applicability of Capsaicin. The ideal patient, dose and interval of use, and the long-term effectiveness were uncertain. Although the authors' conclusions reflected the evidence presented, methodological limitations made the reliability of the conclusions unclear.
