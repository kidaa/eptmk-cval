CRD SUMMARY: This review compared the adverse effects of pramipexole and ropinirole with levodopa and placebo in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The authors concluded that, compared with placebo, ropinirole appears to increase rates of hypotension and somnolence more than pramipexole, while pramipexole increases hallucinations more than ropinirole. These drugs were not compared directly, thus the authors' conclusions may not be reliable.
