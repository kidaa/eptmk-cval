CRD SUMMARY: This review reported that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were effective and well tolerated in the prevention of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, especially in low-risk patients. These findings might not be reliable as there were statistical and clinical differences between trials and a small amount of data was analysed.
