CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that surgical treatment must be considered the standard treatment for severe carotid artery stenosis as there was no evidence that endovascular treatment was safer and it did not provide a better short-term outcome. Problems with review methodology, particularly the lack of validity assessment, mean that it is difficult to determine the reliability of this conclusion.
