CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) increased the risk of cardiac failure, but that the overall risk was low. The risks were similar for conventional NSAIDs and Cox-2 specific non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (COXIBs). There were some methodological problems with the review and these conclusions should be treated with some caution.
