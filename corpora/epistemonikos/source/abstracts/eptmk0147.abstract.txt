CRD SUMMARY: The review evaluated the benefits and harms of late versus early cord clamping in term infants. The authors concluded that delayed clamping is beneficial to the newborn and benefits extend into infancy, although polycythaemia increases. Overall, this was a well-conducted review and the conclusions appear reliable.
