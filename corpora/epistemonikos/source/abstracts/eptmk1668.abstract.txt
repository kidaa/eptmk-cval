CRD SUMMARY: This review concluded that multimodality monitoring including near-infrared spectroscopy may be a useful adjunct to care, but evidence for improvements in neurological outcome was lacking. Aspects of the review were poorly reported and it had some methodological problems, but the caution of the conclusions means that they are probably reliable, despite these concerns.
