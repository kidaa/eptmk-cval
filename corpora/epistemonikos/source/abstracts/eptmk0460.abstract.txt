CRD SUMMARY: This review examined differences between trials assessing the effectiveness of interferon-alpha (IFN) for naive patients with chronic hepatitis C. The authors concluded that differences were mainly associated with different IFN regimens, but hepatitis C virus genotypes, study quality and reporting could also help explain them. The conclusions may not be very reliable as studies might have been missed and error and bias cannot be ruled out.
