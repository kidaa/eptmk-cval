CRD SUMMARY: This review evaluated opioid-related adverse events in studies of opioid sparing with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors compared with placebo in post-operative pain. The authors concluded that opioid sparing with COX-2 inhibitors does not have a clinically beneficial effect on opioid-related adverse events. The conclusion appears reliable based on the data presented, although relevant studies might not have been included.
