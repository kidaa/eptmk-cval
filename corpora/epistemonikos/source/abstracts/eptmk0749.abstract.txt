CRD SUMMARY: The review assessed factors that influence complications after intracapsular hip fractures in young adults. The authors concluded that early or open fracture reduction may not reduce the risk of nonunion or avascular necrosis, and suggested that a higher incidence of nonunion follows open reduction. The conclusions were based on case-series studies; randomised controlled trials are needed to make more definitive conclusions.
