CRD SUMMARY: This review found that magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has a better discriminatory power than duplex ultrasound (DUS) for diagnosing 70-99% stenosis and is sensitive and specific compared with digital subtraction angiography (reference standard). It is difficult to evaluate the conclusions because of lack of detail about the included studies and analysis, and because comparisons of MRA and DUS were indirect.
