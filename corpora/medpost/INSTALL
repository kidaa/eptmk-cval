PREREQUISITES

You must be running on a UNIX system with standard utilities, including perl
and g++.  See the man page for more information.

INSTALLATION

1. Create an installation directory and cd to that directory.

2. Copy the file medpost.tar.gz and unzip:

	% gunzip medpost.tar.gz

3. Extract the files from the tar file:

	% tar xf medpost.tar

4. Complete installation with make:

	% make

If the tagger is moved to a different directory, the install script must be
re-executed.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

To invoke the tagger, assuming the medpost file is in the current PATH, type
the command:

	% medpost [options] < input_file > output_file

If the medpost file is not in the current PATH, type its full path.  The
medpost file (only) may be copied to any desired directory after installation.

MORE INFORMATION

A man page for the medpost program is available in doc/medpost.1.  It
describes the operation of the medpost tagger script, and provides other
useful information about the installation.

If desired, this file can be copied to the system man directory for access
through the man utility.  It can also be formatted for display on any device.
For example, to display it on the terminal,

	% nroff -man doc/medpost.1 | more

to display it in an X window,

	% groff -TX75 -man doc/medpost.1 &

or, to print on a postscript printer,

	% groff -Tps -l -man doc/medpost.1
