<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>Medpost</B>

is a part of speech tagger for MEDLINE.
Text is read from
<I>file</I>

(or standard input
if no file is specified), tokenized,
segmented into sentences,
tagged with parts of speech,
and printed to standard output.
The format of the input file
defaults to ITAME, with XML and MEDLINE
as options.
The output tag set is the
MedPost tag set, with Penn treebank and
SPECIALIST lexicon post-tagger translation options.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-xml</B>

<DD>
The input text is formatted in the XML format
generated by MEDLINE.
<DT><B>-medline</B>

<DD>
The input text is formatted in the MEDLINE format.
<DT><B>-text</B>

<DD>
The input text consists of lines
of text to be tagged.
<DT><B>-idtext</B>

<DD>
Same as -text but with an identifier
on each line preceding text to be tagged.
The identifiers are output as with the -id option.
<DT><B>-token</B>

<DD>
The input text consists of pre-tokenized text,
with tokens separated by white space.
Any tags are removed, if they are appended to a
token by an underscore.
<DT><B>-idtoken</B>

<DD>
Same as -idtoken but with an identifier
on each line preceding pre-tokenized text to be tagged.
The identifiers are output as with the -id option.
<DT><B>-penn</B>

<DD>
The tagged output will be translated
to the Penn treebank tag set.
<DT><B>-id</B>

<DD>
Each line of output is preceeded by an identifier.
Identifiers are constructed from the PMID of the text (or any
alpha-numeric identifier given in the .I field) with an additional
sentence identifier. The sentence identifier is an A or T, depending
on whether the sentence comes from the abstract or title, followed
by the sentence number.
<DT><B>-titles</B>

<DD>
Both titles and abstracts will be tagged.
By default, only abstracts are tagged.
<DT><B>-nosegment</B>

<DD>
Text is tagged without being broken into sentences.
<DT><B>-command</B>

<DD>
Echo the command line (pipeline)
that would be used to invoke the tagger.
The commands are not executed.
<DT><B>-version</B>

<DD>
Print the version date and installation date.
No commands are executed.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TRANSLATION</H2>

<P>
Tagged output can be translated to the Penn treebank tag set
when it is tagged by using the
<B>-penn</B>

option.
Alternatively, text that has been tagged with MedPost tags
and saved to a file can be translated
with the perl script.
<P>
<P>

<B>perl util/tag2penn.perl </B>

[<B>-preserve</B>]

[
<I>file ...</I>

]
<P>
This script can be executed from any directory,
just provide the path name to the perl scripts.
If
<I>file</I>

is not explicitly given on the command line,
then the standard input is read.
If the
<B>-preserve</B>

option is specified,
then any non-tagged text encountered will
be printed to the standard output
without change.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPERATION</H2>

<P>
The shell script
<B>medpost</B>

in the MedPost installation directory
provides the recommended usage of the tagger.
The script will
read text from a file or from standard input for tagging, and
tagged output is written to standard output.
<P>
There are currently three input options for text: ITAME, XML, and
MEDLINE.  The XML and MEDLINE formats are the formats
produced by MEDLINE when saving search results
with one of these display options.
(see <A HREF="http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).">http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).</A>
The default format is the ITAME format,
and this convenient format may be used
when tagging text from non-MEDLINE sources.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ITAME FORMAT</H2>

<P>
The ITAME file format places all text of interest on lines beginning
with a period, followed by a field indicator, followed by the text
of the field.
The text in each field should appear
on a single line with no line breaks.
The field indicators are
<P>
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>I<DD>
identifier
<DT>T<DD>
title
<DT>A<DD>
abstract
<DT>E<DD>
end of record
</DL>
</DL>


<P>
<P>
The M field indicator, from which the ITAME acronym is derived, stands
for MeSH, but this field is ignored by the tagger.
Furthermore, any line that does not start in this way is ignored.
<P>
As an example, the record for the
PUBMED abstract with PMID 2359731 would look like
<P>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>&gt; .I2359731<DD>
<DT>&gt; .TGiant centrifugal miliaria profunda.<DD>
<DT>&gt; .AA 4-month-old developed rapidly enlarging ...<DD>
<DT>&gt; .E<DD>
</DL>
</DL>


<P>
The input file, regardless of its format, may contain
arbitrarily many records.
The identifiers are used only
to construct sentence identifiers
(for the
<B>-id</B>

option)
, and whether derived from MEDLINE
or not, they need not be unique.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INSTALLATION</H2>

<P>
The script file
<B>medpost</B>

may be invoked from
any directory, or copied to any directory
and executed.
However, after moving or renaming the install directory,
it must be re-installed by typing
<B>make</B>

or, equivalently, by executing the perl script
<B>util/install.perl.</B>

<P>
If the installation script fails, the installation
can be completed by hand.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.<DD>
Edit the
<B>medpost</B>

file, which is a shell script, and set the
<B>TAGGER_HOME</B>

variable to the path name
of the MedPost installation.
For reference, the install script
also updates the
<B>IDATE</B>

variable to contain the date and time of the installation.
<DT>2.<DD>
Set the working directory to the src directory
and type
<B>make.</B>

The make file in this directory
uses the
<B>g++</B>

compiler by default,
but the install script will replace this with
<B>CC</B>

under solaris operating systems.
If your system has a different C++ compiler,
edit the
<B>src/makefile</B>

and set the
<B>CC</B>

variable to the command name.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>TESTING</H2>

<P>
Input text has been provided for testing, together with
the tagged text that should result.
The files
<B>test/query.itame,</B>

<B>test/query.medline</B>

and
<B>test/query.xml</B>

contain the results
of a MEDLINE query, and
<B>test/query.tagged</B>

is the result of tagging any of these.
After successful installation,
to execute the test script,
change the working directory to the
<B>test</B>

subdirectory
and execute the shell script
<B>runtest,</B>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>% sh runtest</B>

</DL>

<P>
If any differences are encountered,
a message will be displayed,
which may indicate an error in the installation.
<BR>&nbsp;
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>INTERNALS</H2>

<P>
The
<B>medpost</B>

script invokes the program
<B>util/tokenizer</B>

to perform all tokenization and segmentation of input.
This program generates commands
that are read by the
<B>util/tagger</B>

program directing it to tag the sentences and print the results.
If specified, the output is passed to
<B>util/tag2penn.perl</B>

to translate the MedPost tags
to Penn treebank tag set
before printing.
These programs are executed
by the shell in a pipeline, and each program has
been written to process one line at a time as it
is read, allowing tagged output may appear before
tokenization of the input file has completed.
<P>
The lexicon is stored in
<B>medpost.lex</B>

and the ngram frequencies are stored in
<B>medpost.ngrams.</B>

In addition, a file
<B>medpost.pairs</B>

contains some abbreviations
that are used by the sentence segmenter.
<P>
The tokenizer and tagger are implemented as C++ classes,
and these functions can be called directly from a C++
program. See the example files
(MPtokEX1.C,
MPtokEX2.C,
MPtokEX3.C,
MPtagEX1.C,
and MPtagEX2.C)
in the src directory.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>WORD DATABASE</H2>

<P>
An ASCII database of the 100,000 most frequent words
from MEDLINE is available in the file models/words.db.
The words of MEDLINE were mapped to lower case,
then all strings of digits were converted to a single digit 1,
and all punctuation was changed to the string ``.punctuation.''
These words are then sorted by their descending frequency
in MEDLINE and are followed by the part of speech tags,
and the number of times each tag is
assigned to that word by the tagger.
If a tag entry has a ``+'' appearing before or after it,
it indicates that the word was tagged
as part of a multi-word lexical item.
