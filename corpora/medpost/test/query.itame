.TLocal treatments for cutaneous warts.
.ABACKGROUND: Viral warts caused by the human papilloma virus represent one of the most common diseases of the skin. Any area of skin can be affected although the hands and feet are by far the commonest sites. A very wide range of local treatments are available. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of different local treatments for cutaneous, non-genital warts in healthy people. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (January 2003), the Skin Group trials register (January 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) and a number of other key biomedical and health economics databases. In addition the cited references of all trials identified and key review articles were searched. Pharmaceutical companies involved in local treatments for warts and experts in the field were contacted. The most recent searches were carried SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of local treatments for cutaneous non-genital viral warts in immunocompetent human hosts were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection and assessment of methodological quality were carried out by two independent reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty two trials were identified which fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the review. The evidence provided by these studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting.In 17 trials with placebo groups that used participants as the unit of analysis the average cure rate of placebo preparations was 30% (range 0 to 73%) after an average period of 10 weeks (range 4 to 24 weeks).The best available evidence was for simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid, which are clearly better than placebo. Data pooled from six placebo-controlled trials show a cure rate of 144/191 (75%) compared with 89/185 (48%) in controls, odds ratio 3.91 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to 6.36), random effects model.Most of the bigger trials of cryotherapy studied different regimens rather than comparing cryotherapy with other treatments or placebo. Pooled data from two small trials that included cryotherapy and placebo or no treatment, showed no significant difference in cure rates. In two trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid and one comparing duct tape with cryotherapy no significant difference in efficacy was demonstrated.There was no consistent evidence for the effectiveness of intralesional bleomycin. Four studies, using warts rather than individuals as the unit of analysis, had widely varying results which could not be meaningfully pooled.There was some evidence for the efficacy of dinitrochlorobenzene, a potent contact sensitizer. Pooled data from two small studies comparing dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo showed cure rates of 32/40 (80%) and 15/40 (38%) respectively, odds ratio 6.67 (95% confidence interval 2.44 to 18.23), random effects model.Only limited evidence was found for the efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil, intralesional interferons and photodynamic therapy.Bleomycin, dinitrochlorobenzene, 5-fluorouracil, interferons and photodynamic therapy are potentially hazardous or toxic treatments. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is a considerable lack of evidence on which to base the rational use of the local treatments for common warts. The reviewed trials are highly variable in method and quality. Cure rates with placebo preparations are variable but nevertheless considerable. There is certainly evidence that simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic effect. There is less evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy and some evidence that it is only of equivalent efficacy to simpler, safer treatments. Dinitrochlorobenzene appears to be effective but there were no statistically significant differences when compared with the safer, simpler and cheaper topical treatments containing salicylic acid. The benefits and risks of 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, interferons and photodynamic therapy remain to be determined.

.TExtent of fungal growth on fiberglass duct liners with and without biocides under challenging environmental conditions.
.AEight brands of fiberglass duct liners, including three that contained biocides, were exposed to challenging environmental conditions that would promote fungal growth. Twenty-four rectangular sheet metal ducts in three groups of eight ducts per group were lined with the eight selected liners. Each group of ducts was exposed to one of the three test conditions within an environmental chamber for a period of 15 days. These conditions were a) 75 percent RH, b) 75 percent RH plus water spray, c) 75 percent RH plus dry nutrient, and d) 75 percent RH plus water plus nutrient. Viable spores of Aspergillus niger were aerosolized into each duct as seed. On the 16th day, air and surface samples for fungal spores were collected from inside ducts. The results of air sampling using N6 sampler and visual inspection indicated that two out of three biocide-containing liners, Permacote and Toughgard, inhibited fungal growth but only under condition A. The third biocide-containing liner, Aeroflex Plus, was effective even when it was wet (conditions A and B). All three biocide-containing liners failed to inhibit fungal growth under conditions C and D. Among the five other types of liners that did not contain biocides, ATCO Flex with a smooth Mylar coating was more preferable, exhibiting lower fungal activity during conditions A, B, and C. All liners failed under condition D when nutrient and water were added together. Surface sampling using adhesive tape failed to produce representative results, apparently due to rough/porous surface of duct liners. It was concluded that duct liners with biocide treatment could be less promoting to microbial growth under high humidity as long as their surfaces remain clean and water-free. A liner with an impermeable and smooth surface seems to be less subject to microbial growth under most conditions than biocide-containing liners having porous and/or rough surfaces.

.TThe renal pelvis: machinery that concentrates urine in the papilla.
.ATwo decades ago, Bodil Schmidt-Nielsen and Bruce Graves documented the rhythmic contractions of the renal pelvis in a remarkable video, visually demonstrating how peristaltic waves empty the papilla and how the subsequent elastic recoil draws water from the collecting duct and into the tethered-open ascending vasa recta. Thus a periodic hydrostatic gradient generates an axial osmotic gradient. This review recapitulates the video and offers a link to figures and scenes digitized from the original tape.

.T[Lymphoscintigraphy for chylothorax after replacement of descending thoracic aortic aneurysm]
.AA 77-year-old female with Stanford B chronic aortic dissection, received elective replacement of descending aorta. The aorta distal to the aneurysm was encircled with a tape, and replaced using the double barrel technique. After the operation, chest X-ray showed effusion on the bilateral side. The amount of milky fluid from drain increased to 2,000 ml per day. The chemical profiles of the fluids were compatible with chylothorax. The Thoracic duct near the diaphragm was closed through left mini-thoracotomy. But the leakage of chyle did not cease. The lymphoscintigraphy showed a leakage to right lower intrathorax near the diaphragm and native aorta. A defect of the thoracic duct was closed, and chylothorax was cured. This case shows that though detailed anatomical structure of thoracic duct is not revealed, lymphoscintigraphy is useful for the localization of leakage in patients with chylothorax of post-cardiovascular-surgery.

.TThe efficacy of duct tape vs cryotherapy in the treatment of verruca vulgaris (the common wart).
.AOBJECTIVE: To determine if application of duct tape is as effective as cryotherapy in the treatment of common warts. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms for warts in children. SETTING: The general pediatric and adolescent clinics at a military medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 61 patients (age range, 3-22 years) were enrolled in the study from October 31, 2000, to July 25, 2001; 51 patients completed the study and were available for analysis. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized using computer-generated codes to receive either cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen applied to each wart for 10 seconds every 2-3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 treatments or duct tape occlusion (applied directly to the wart) for a maximum of 2 months. Patients had their warts measured at baseline and with return visits. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Complete resolution of the wart being studied. RESULTS: Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2) analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so within the first month of treatment. CONCLUSION: Duct tape occlusion therapy was significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of the common wart.

.TEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography causes reduced myocardial blood flow.
.ABACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Previous studies have shown that up to 50% of healthy patients may develop ST-segment changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of the study was to evaluate myocardial blood flow in patients during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 patients scheduled for ERCP were monitored with a Holter tape recorder and underwent myocardial perfusion scintigraphies, to evaluate myocardial perfusion at rest and during ERCP. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the study. Eight patients had no sign of myocardial ischemia with either of the two methods, while two patients developed signs of ischemia during ERCP with both the Holter tape recording and on myocardial scintigraphy (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing ERCP may develop true myocardial ischemia with reduced myocardial blood flow. Although this is a small-scale study, these findings strongly support the use of alternative methods for diagnostic evaluation of the pancreatic duct and biliary tree.

.TNeutrophil chemotaxis in bile duct-obstructed rats, and effect of internal biliary drainage.
.ABACKGROUND/AIMS: Our previous studies demonstrated enhanced neutrophil chemotaxis in bile duct-ligated, obstructive jaundice rats. In the present study, we produced a reversible obstructive jaundice model in rats. The efficacy of the present model in producing sufficient bile flow blockade and subsequent internal biliary drainage was assessed. Furthermore, the effect of internal biliary drainage on neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Bile duct was obstructed with a polyester tape attached with a stainless steel coil. Internal biliary drainage was performed by removing the tape. Rats were subjected to either 10 days' bile duct obstruction or 4 days' bile duct obstruction followed by 6 days' internal biliary drainage. Some animals underwent conventional bile duct ligation and dissection for 4 or 10 days. Neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated with a modified Boyden method using interleukin-8 (recombinant rat Gro-beta) as chemoattractant. RESULTS: The present technique produced sufficient obstructive jaundice as evidenced by increases in serum alanine aminotransferase and total bilirubin throughout the observation period, the values of which were insignificant with those induced by the conventional method. Internal biliary drainage effectively normalized these values. Similarly, neutrophil chemotaxis was enhanced with both procedures, and increased neutrophil chemotaxis was significantly decreased after drainage. CONCLUSIONS: The present reversible obstructive jaundice method is as efficacious as the conventional method for producing obstructive jaundice, and internal biliary drainage could be readily available. With the present model, neutrophil overactivity in obstructive jaundice was effectively alleviated by internal biliary drainage. The result may support the role of preoperative biliary drainage in the prevention of postoperative septic complications.

.TThe field comparison of three measuring techniques for evaluation of the surface dust level in ventilation ducts.
.AThis paper reports the comparison of three measuring methods for quantifying the amount of dust on the inner surface of ventilation ducts: 1) a vacuum test method; 2) a gravimetric tape method; and 3) an optical method. Thirteen recently constructed buildings were selected for the field test in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The dust samples in each method were all taken from the same location in the duct. Most of the ducts sampled had no residual oil originating from the manufacturing process. The mean amount of dust measured with the vacuum test method was 1.3 g/m2 and the range was < 0.1-8.4 g/m2. The mean surface dust level measured using the gravimetric tape method was slightly lower, i.e. 1.2 g/m2 (< 0.1-5.0 g/m2). The mean cleanliness level of the ducts was 15% (2-41%) using the optical method. The wide variations and differences in the results of the different methods were caused by the unequal distribution of dust on the duct surfaces.

.TAnalysis of pressure sensitive adhesive tape: I. Evaluation of infrared ATR accessory advances
.AAttenuated total reflection (ATR), also known as internal reflection spectroscopy (IRS), is a forensically accepted method for infrared (IR) analysis of pressure sensitive adhesive tapes. Advancements of ATR accessories in the last decade have provided the forensic examiner several ATR methods to choose from. These accessories offer a variety of ATR crystal choices with a variety of prices and capabilities. Four different types of pressure sensitive adhesive tapes including duct tape, electrical tape, packaging tape and office tape have been used to compare six different ATR methods. Each of the methods tested offers both benefits and limitaltions which must be considered for the type of sample to be analyze. The intent of this paper is to assist the reader in better understanding ATR techniques, the many differences among currently available ATR accessories and how the method is applied to the analysis of pressure sensitive adhesive tape.

.TSurgical correction of patent ductus venosus in three brothers.
.AWe report the presence of a patent ductus venosus in three brothers who underwent surgical correction. Patent ductus venosus was demonstrated by ultrasonography. Portosystemic venous shunt ratios as evaluated by [123I]iodoamphetamine per rectal portal scintigraphy were 67%, 50%, and 77%, respectively. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens revealed fatty degeneration in all cases. Portal vein pressure before and after temporarily occluding the patent ductus venosus was estimated by an Anthron P-U catheter introduced into the portal vein via the ligament teres hepatis. Portal venous pressure increased from 10 to 17 cm H2O, 16 to 23 cm H2O, and 14 to 27 cm H2O, respectively. Therefore, banding of the ductus venosus with Teflon tape was attempted to prevent portal hypertension following complete ligation. As a result, portal venous pressures after stricture of the ductus venosus were 12, 21, and 20 cm H2), respectively. Bile acid and liver enzymes decreased and returned to normal within 14 days after surgery. Interestingly, serum concentrations of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increased significantly after restoration of the portal blood flow and then gradually decreased, but remained persistently elevated for at least two weeks in two cases measured after surgical correction. One month after correction, liver function returned to normal as assessed by serological and histological parameters in all cases. These results suggest that it is important to determine whether stricture or complete ligation is indicated for a patent ductus venosus during surgical correction, based on the portal venous pressure after temporal test occlusion of the duct. In addition, HGF may be a useful marker for normalization of hepatic microcirculation after surgery.

.TFixation-induced shrinkage of Reissner's membrane and its potential influence on the assessment of endolymph volume.
.AThe quantification of endolymph volume by histological techniques or by magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy requires the inner ear to be first treated with chemical fixatives. If the fixative induces soft-tissue shrinkage, it would tend to return a distended Reissner's membrane towards a straight position, since this membrane is anchored to bone at its medial and lateral edges. The goal of this study was to determine the degree of Reissner's membrane shrinkage induced by different fixation protocols to establish methods which minimize tissue shrinkage. Fragments of fresh Reissner's membrane were dissected from isolated cochleae in an artificial perilymph. Specimens were viewed with an inverted microscope during infusion of fixatives, and changes recorded on video tape. Size changes of the specimen were quantified, usually over a 20 min period. Heidenhain-Susa, a fixative which is widely used in histological studies of hydropic cochleae, caused substantial shrinkage of Reissner's membrane, decreasing the length of specimens by an average of 15.1%. Other fixation procedures induced far less shrinkage. The use of 3.1% glutaraldehyde in Hanks' balanced salt solution produced a mean length decrease of only 0.3%. The inclusion in the fixation medium of 4.5% mercuric chloride, corresponding to the concentration which is present in Heidenhain-Susa and which acts to increase the contrast of Reissner's membrane in MR microscopy, contributes significantly to specimen shrinkage. We can conclude that the degree of endolymphatic hydrops may be underestimated in specimens fixed with media containing high levels of mercuric chloride.

.TA new technique for exposing Calot's triangle during laparoscopic surgery: usefulness of extracorporeal lifting of the round ligament and gallbladder.
.AWe developed a maneuver for holding and lifting the intraperitoneal organs from the extracorporeal side using a new instrument, the leading bar, by which we could guide the tape or the thread to the outside of the abdomen. In the case of cholecystolithiasis with a thickened wall or a stone stuck in the neck, we lifted the round ligament and gallbladder for better exposure of Calot's triangle, using the tape or thread through the abdominal wall to the extracorporeal side, and then clamped them with Kocher's forceps. With this technique, a good view of Calot's triangle was maintained so that the surgeon could expose the cystic duct easily and safely using both hands.

.TIntra-operative and postoperative biliary endoscopy (choledochoscopy). The role of the surgeons.
.AIntra-operative and postoperative choledochoscopy is an important adjunct to biliary surgery. In the last two decades, the necessity of this examination became obvious but two surveys clearly indicated that despite the availability of instruments surgeons do not use it routinely. One of the reasons is the long learning curve and the limited experience. The introduction of the video choledochoscope opened a new chapter because the surgeon could learn it faster and the technique is easier to use. Choledochoscopy is a "two man" job, requiring four hands. Using video choledochoscopy, the assistant and the operator can observe the situation together, therefore coordination of movement is easier. The actual endoscopic procedure is faster and the location of the stone, its removal, and the sphincter function are recorded on tape. This is a great step forward in analyzing sphincter function. It became the method of choice in teaching. It is assumed that, with the introduction of video choledochoscopy, the incidence of missed stones will be decreased significantly.

.TInduction of nesidioblastosis will reverse diabetes in Syrian golden hamster.
.ANesidioblastosis, which is the formation of new islets and the differentiation of cells within the islets, represents part of the spectrum of hyperfunctioning states of the islets of Langerhans at the clinical level. Nesidioblastosis in the Syrian golden hamster can be induced by wrapping the head of the pancreas with cellophane tape. Ligation of the duct is not involved, and acinar cell atrophy does not occur. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the induction of nesidioblastosis could be used as a means of reversing streptozocin-induced diabetes. Outbred hamsters (n = 32), 8 wk of age, were rendered diabetic by treatment with 40 mg/kg i.p. streptozocin, administered daily for 3 days. Four days later, 16 animals chosen at random underwent laparotomy with cellophane wrapping of the pancreas. Before surgery, the serum glucose and insulin levels (means +/- SE) in the unoperated control animals (389.0 +/- 18.6, 33.9 +/- 3.8) did not differ from those in the animals awaiting the operation (373.2 +/- 18.6, 37.9 +/- 3.8). After 7 wk, 50% of the operated animals had serum glucose and insulin levels that were normal, compared to only 12% of the unoperated control animals (chi2 = 5.53, P less than .05). Islets from normoglycemic operated animals were characterized by increased numbers, including many small islets, positive immunoreactive insulin staining, and minimal vacuolation of cells. Islets from hyperglycemic operated hamsters and from the unoperated control animals were decreased in number and generally larger in size, demonstrated little or no immunoreactive insulin staining, and exhibited marked vacuolation of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Many sebaceous follicles appear quiescent in normals and with acne patients. Most of the large spots on the lipid-absorbent tape are due to the confluence of smaller ones.

.TChylopericardium following cardiac surgery.
.AChylopericardium is one of the rarest complications of cardiac surgery. The authors report only the 19th case, that of a 12-year-old boy. The chylopericardium developed after an aortic valvotomy, even though the retropericardial portion of the mediastinum was entered only to pass a tape around the ascending aorta. Etiologic factors are directly or indirectly related to injury to the thoracic duct or tis tributaries. Treatment initially is conservative, consisting of adequate pericardial drainage and a low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diet. If this fails, the appropriate operative procedure is carried out.

.TDevelopment of experimental cancer in the head of the pancreas by surgical induction of tissue injury.
.AThe majority of carcinomas of the pancreas in humans are of ductal origin and are located in the head of the gland. These clinical characteristics however, are not affected in traditional animal models of the disease. Partial pancreatic duct obstruction with ductal epithelial hyperplasia was produced in the Syrian golden hamster by wrapping the head of the pancreas with cellophane tape. Wrapped and unwrapped animals were then exposed to an exogenous carcinogen (N-nitrosobis[2-oxopropyl]amine). Assay of serum ribonuclease activity was used as a marker of disease. Invasive lesions developed in both groups of animals. Fifty percent of the tumors in the Group II (cellophane wrap and N-nitrosobis [2-oxopropyl] amine) hamsters were located in the head of the gland and were of ductal origin. All tumors in animals receiving N-nitrosobis [2-oxopropyl]amine alone (Group I) occurred peripherally and were derived from ductular or acinar tissue. Elevation of serum ribonuclease activity was noted early in the course of carcinogenesis, thereafter returning to normal, which may explain the clinical controversy regarding this marker. This new model should enhance our knowledge of the interrelationships between etiologic factors, precursor lesions, and pancreatic cancer.

.TA new approach to the induction of duct epithelial hyperplasia and nesidioblastosis by cellophane wrapping of the hamster pancreas.
.AThere is ample evidence that a relationship exists between duct epithelial hyperplasia and carcinoma of the pancreas. However, no experimental system exists to investigate the mechanisms involved. A new model is described in the Syrian golden hamster for inducing duct epithelial hyperplasia and nesidioblastosis. The head of the pancreas is wrapped with cellophane tape; ligation of the duct is not involved and there is no evidence of diffuse pancreatitis. Preliminary studies have revealed that this model results in periductal fibrosis in relation to the cellophane thus producing partial duct obstruction. Concomitant with the fibrosis there is duct epithelial hyperplasia in the head of the gland, while peripherally there is ductular proliferation and the initiation of nesidioblastosis. It is believed that this model will be of use in studies of pancreatic carcinogenesis and will thus enhance our knowledge of the interrelationships between etiologic factors, precursor lesions, and pancreatic cancer. This is of particular importance in the early recognition of this neoplasm in man.

.TNew methods used to investigate the control of mucus secretion and ion transport in airways.
.AOur group developed two in vivo methods to study secretions from submucosal glands in exposed tracheal epithelium. (1) The exposed mucosal surface was coated with powdered tantalum; accumulated secretions produced elevations (hillocks) in the tantalum layer under which the duct openings were located. The rate of formation of the hillocks was observed through a dissecting microscope, and recorded by television on a video tape recorder. (2) Micropipets were used to collect timed samples from individual gland duct openings. With these techniques, the innervation of the submucosal glands and the autonomic regulation of their secretions were studied. We studied the control of ion movement across tracheal epithelium because active ion transport forms local osmotic gradients across epithelia which could regulate transepithelial water movement. We mounted pieces of the posterior wall of dog trachea in Ussing-type chambers and measured unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ under short-circuit conditions with 36Cl and 24Na. We found active transport of Cl- toward the lumen and Na+ toward the submucosa. With this technique we investigated the effect of parasympathomimetic drugs on ion movement. With a new in vitro method we studied output of 35S bound to sulfated mucins and movement of ions in cat trachea. We mounted pieces of anterior tracheal wall in Ussing-type chambers, added sodium 35S-sulfate to the submucosal side and monitored secretion of bound 35S in samples from the luminal side after dialysis. The unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ were measured with 36Cl and 22Na. With this method we examined the effect of alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic agonists on mucin secretion and ion movement. Also with this preparation we studied the relationship between the permeability of the paracellular pathway to 14C-sucrose and the pattern of tight junction strands.

.TAdenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus: a light and electron microscopic study.
.AThe light and electron microscopic appearances of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus are presented. Typical light microscopic features of adenoid cystic carcinoma were seen, but a unique additional feature was the presence at one edge of the tumor of gland-like structures lined entirely by tumor cells and opening onto an intact esophageal epithelium. Electron microscopy showed cystic spaces containing replicated basement membrane surrounded by epithelial cells with occasional myoepithelial cells at the interface. Rare lumina were seen between the cells with microvilli projecting into them. Occasional epithelial cells contained granules of neurosecretory tape. Both the light and electron microscopic findings strongly support an origin from the intercalated duct of esophageal mucus glands. The paucity of gland lumina may represent a lesser degree of differentiation which would accord well with the known biological aggressiveness of the tumor at this site.

.TConjunctival transport of technetium-99m pertechnetate.
.AUsing a gamma camera coupled to a computer and a tape unit the transport of pertechnetate (Tc99m) across the conjunctiva was determined by the 'region of interest' technique in human subjects. In 11 patients with their lacrimal sacs removed a fractional turnover rate of 0.021 min-1 was found. In 21 patients with inflammed conjunctiva due to chronic dacryocystitis a fractional turnover rate of 0.027 min-1 was found, whereas the value in 11 normal individuals was 0.015 min-1. Neglecting the relatively small transcorneal route of disappearance, the values found for technetium disappearance could be regarded as representative for the transconjunctival transport of the radioisotope. This assumption was confirmed by correlating the radioactivity in the blood with the fractional turnover rate.

.T[Effects of chronic and progressive obstruction of the main pancreatic duct on the epithelium of the ducts and the exocrine pancreatic tissue]
.AThe alarming increase in the number of clinical cases of carcinoma of the pancreas provides the stimulation to search for an experimental model that produces chronic progressive obstruction of the main pancreatic duct. Fifteen mongrel dogs were studied for 1 to 11 weeks. To induce chronic progressive obstruction of the pancreatic duct, a cellophane tape was placed around the main duct adjacent to its entrance into the duodenum and tied over a needle with a diameter identical to that of the duct; the needle was then withdrawn. All minor ducts were identified by pancreatography and then ligated with 2-0 silk. Each animal was followed up by repeated ductal pancreatography and measurements of serum amylase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Histologic, histochemical and ultrastructural studies were also performed. On both gross and microscopic examination each animal demonstrated chronic pancreatitis with preservation of the islands of Langerhans. In the early period (4 to 7 days) complete ductal obstruction occurred as demonstrated by pancreatography and by elevated serum values for amylase (264% increase) and alkaline phosphatase (209% increase). In contrast to what is seen after acute ductal ligation, the ductal epithelial cells increased in number and height. At 4 weeks a new collateral ductal system had developed and serum amylase and alkaline phosphatase values had reverted to normal. This model is useful in studying the kinetics of pancreatic ductal regeneration and the pathophysiology associated with chronic pancreatic ductal obstruction.

.AFour to 48 hours after iv and sc administration of teratogenic doses of trypan blue to rats and mice the uterus was removed and rapidly frozen, after having been placed in a horizontal plane, and frozen sections were attached to tape and dried at a low temperature. By this procedure embryos and placental structures were present in the same sections and loss or redistribution of the dye was minimized. The dye was found in the yolk-sac cavity and to be accumulated in the visceral (proximal) endoderm. It was also acculmulated in the embryonic endoderm--forming the embryonic gut. This accumulation occurred after the administration of the trypan blue up to the time of closure of the vitelline duct, which occurs at 11 days postconception in rats and 9.5 days in mice. None was found when injection was made after this closure. No dye was detected in the ecto- and mesodermal layers. The period of embryonic uptake of trypan blue largely corresponds with the period of teratogenic sensitivity in these species as reported by others.

.T[Rearing and management of chimpanzees for experimental infection with hepatitis B virus (author's transl)]
.AFor the purpose of experimental infection with human hepatitis B virus, 14 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were delivered to the Division of Animal Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo. These chimps, 11 males and 3 females, born in the West Africa, had been reared for two to six months. Several days after delivery, they were anesthetized with Ketalar in order to make clinical, bacteriological and parasitological examinations; It was found that one of them was in malnutrition, and that another had dislocation of the shoulder joint and the associating abscess. All of them were negative for tuberculin test. In the bacteriological examination, Shigella sonnei was detected in the feces from one of them. Mycoplasma sp. was detected in the materials from the oral cavity of four head. As intestinal parasites, Ascaris sp. were detected in two head, Enterobius vermicularis in eight, Strongloides sp. in two, Oesophagostomum sp. in nine, tape worms in four, and Entamoeba coli in twelve. Microfilaria as blood parasite was detected in 11 of them. The laboratory used for the experimental infection was a room occupying about 42 m2, which had been built by renovating a part of our division building. Each of the cages used for rearing the chimps was contained in the isolation box made of stainless steel. The contaminated air in the isolation box was discharged forcedly into the exhausting duct with a fan, and further passed through the HEPA filter and the Miraceram honeycomb heater, and was then conducted to the already existing ventilation duct of the division building. Each chimp was fed on a ration of 200-350 g of the imported "Purina Monkey Chow 25" and also one grapefruit and one banana daily for the supply of vitamin C. The chimps weighed 16.1 kg on the average on delivery, but gained an average weight of 4.2 kg during the following four months.
