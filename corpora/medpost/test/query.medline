TI  - Local treatments for cutaneous warts.
PG  - CD001781
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral warts caused by the human papilloma virus represent one
      of the most common diseases of the skin. Any area of skin can be affected
      although the hands and feet are by far the commonest sites. A very wide
      range of local treatments are available. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects
      of different local treatments for cutaneous, non-genital warts in healthy
      people. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials
      Register (January 2003), the Skin Group trials register (January 2003),
      MEDLINE (1966 to January 2003), EMBASE (1980 to January 2003) and a number
      of other key biomedical and health economics databases. In addition the
      cited references of all trials identified and key review articles were
      searched. Pharmaceutical companies involved in local treatments for warts
      and experts in the field were contacted. The most recent searches were
      carried SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of local
      treatments for cutaneous non-genital viral warts in immunocompetent human
      hosts were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Study selection and
      assessment of methodological quality were carried out by two independent
      reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty two trials were identified which fulfilled
      the criteria for inclusion in the review. The evidence provided by these
      studies was generally weak because of poor methodology and reporting.In 17
      trials with placebo groups that used participants as the unit of analysis
      the average cure rate of placebo preparations was 30% (range 0 to 73%)
      after an average period of 10 weeks (range 4 to 24 weeks).The best
      available evidence was for simple topical treatments containing salicylic
      acid, which are clearly better than placebo. Data pooled from six
      placebo-controlled trials show a cure rate of 144/191 (75%) compared with
      89/185 (48%) in controls, odds ratio 3.91 (95% confidence interval 2.40 to
      6.36), random effects model.Most of the bigger trials of cryotherapy
      studied different regimens rather than comparing cryotherapy with other
      treatments or placebo. Pooled data from two small trials that included
      cryotherapy and placebo or no treatment, showed no significant difference
      in cure rates. In two trials comparing cryotherapy with salicylic acid and
      one comparing duct tape with cryotherapy no significant difference in
      efficacy was demonstrated.There was no consistent evidence for the
      effectiveness of intralesional bleomycin. Four studies, using warts rather
      than individuals as the unit of analysis, had widely varying results which
      could not be meaningfully pooled.There was some evidence for the efficacy
      of dinitrochlorobenzene, a potent contact sensitizer. Pooled data from two
      small studies comparing dinitrochlorobenzene with placebo showed cure
      rates of 32/40 (80%) and 15/40 (38%) respectively, odds ratio 6.67 (95%
      confidence interval 2.44 to 18.23), random effects model.Only limited
      evidence was found for the efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil,
      intralesional interferons and photodynamic therapy.Bleomycin,
      dinitrochlorobenzene, 5-fluorouracil, interferons and photodynamic therapy
      are potentially hazardous or toxic treatments. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS:
      There is a considerable lack of evidence on which to base the rational use
      of the local treatments for common warts. The reviewed trials are highly
      variable in method and quality. Cure rates with placebo preparations are
      variable but nevertheless considerable. There is certainly evidence that
      simple topical treatments containing salicylic acid have a therapeutic
      effect. There is less evidence for the efficacy of cryotherapy and some
      evidence that it is only of equivalent efficacy to simpler, safer
      treatments. Dinitrochlorobenzene appears to be effective but there were no
      statistically significant differences when compared with the safer,
      simpler and cheaper topical treatments containing salicylic acid. The
      benefits and risks of 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, interferons and
      photodynamic therapy remain to be determined.

TI  - Extent of fungal growth on fiberglass duct liners with and without
      biocides under challenging environmental conditions.
PG  - 193-9
AB  - Eight brands of fiberglass duct liners, including three that contained
      biocides, were exposed to challenging environmental conditions that would
      promote fungal growth. Twenty-four rectangular sheet metal ducts in three
      groups of eight ducts per group were lined with the eight selected liners.
      Each group of ducts was exposed to one of the three test conditions within
      an environmental chamber for a period of 15 days. These conditions were a)
      75 percent RH, b) 75 percent RH plus water spray, c) 75 percent RH plus
      dry nutrient, and d) 75 percent RH plus water plus nutrient. Viable spores
      of Aspergillus niger were aerosolized into each duct as seed. On the 16th
      day, air and surface samples for fungal spores were collected from inside
      ducts. The results of air sampling using N6 sampler and visual inspection
      indicated that two out of three biocide-containing liners, Permacote and
      Toughgard, inhibited fungal growth but only under condition A. The third
      biocide-containing liner, Aeroflex Plus, was effective even when it was
      wet (conditions A and B). All three biocide-containing liners failed to
      inhibit fungal growth under conditions C and D. Among the five other types
      of liners that did not contain biocides, ATCO Flex with a smooth Mylar
      coating was more preferable, exhibiting lower fungal activity during
      conditions A, B, and C. All liners failed under condition D when nutrient
      and water were added together. Surface sampling using adhesive tape failed
      to produce representative results, apparently due to rough/porous surface
      of duct liners. It was concluded that duct liners with biocide treatment
      could be less promoting to microbial growth under high humidity as long as
      their surfaces remain clean and water-free. A liner with an impermeable
      and smooth surface seems to be less subject to microbial growth under most
      conditions than biocide-containing liners having porous and/or rough
      surfaces.

TI  - The renal pelvis: machinery that concentrates urine in the papilla.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - Two decades ago, Bodil Schmidt-Nielsen and Bruce Graves documented the
      rhythmic contractions of the renal pelvis in a remarkable video, visually
      demonstrating how peristaltic waves empty the papilla and how the
      subsequent elastic recoil draws water from the collecting duct and into
      the tethered-open ascending vasa recta. Thus a periodic hydrostatic
      gradient generates an axial osmotic gradient. This review recapitulates
      the video and offers a link to figures and scenes digitized from the
      original tape.

TI  - [Lymphoscintigraphy for chylothorax after replacement of descending
      thoracic aortic aneurysm]
PG  - 1035-8
AB  - A 77-year-old female with Stanford B chronic aortic dissection, received
      elective replacement of descending aorta. The aorta distal to the aneurysm
      was encircled with a tape, and replaced using the double barrel technique.
      After the operation, chest X-ray showed effusion on the bilateral side.
      The amount of milky fluid from drain increased to 2,000 ml per day. The
      chemical profiles of the fluids were compatible with chylothorax. The
      Thoracic duct near the diaphragm was closed through left mini-thoracotomy.
      But the leakage of chyle did not cease. The lymphoscintigraphy showed a
      leakage to right lower intrathorax near the diaphragm and native aorta. A
      defect of the thoracic duct was closed, and chylothorax was cured. This
      case shows that though detailed anatomical structure of thoracic duct is
      not revealed, lymphoscintigraphy is useful for the localization of leakage
      in patients with chylothorax of post-cardiovascular-surgery.

TI  - The efficacy of duct tape vs cryotherapy in the treatment of verruca
      vulgaris (the common wart).
PG  - 971-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if application of duct tape is as effective as
      cryotherapy in the treatment of common warts. DESIGN: A prospective,
      randomized controlled trial with 2 treatment arms for warts in children.
      SETTING: The general pediatric and adolescent clinics at a military
      medical center. PATIENTS: A total of 61 patients (age range, 3-22 years)
      were enrolled in the study from October 31, 2000, to July 25, 2001; 51
      patients completed the study and were available for analysis.
      INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized using computer-generated codes to
      receive either cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen applied to each wart for 10
      seconds every 2-3 weeks) for a maximum of 6 treatments or duct tape
      occlusion (applied directly to the wart) for a maximum of 2 months.
      Patients had their warts measured at baseline and with return visits. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURE: Complete resolution of the wart being studied. RESULTS:
      Of the 51 patients completing the study, 26 (51%) were treated with duct
      tape, and 25 (49%) were treated with cryotherapy. Twenty-two patients
      (85%) in the duct tape arm vs 15 patients (60%) enrolled in the
      cryotherapy arm had complete resolution of their warts (P =.05 by chi(2)
      analysis). The majority of warts that responded to either therapy did so
      within the first month of treatment. CONCLUSION: Duct tape occlusion
      therapy was significantly more effective than cryotherapy for treatment of
      the common wart.

TI  - Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography causes reduced myocardial
      blood flow.
PG  - 797-800
AB  - BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Previous studies have shown that up to 50% of
      healthy patients may develop ST-segment changes during upper
      gastrointestinal endoscopy. The aim of the study was to evaluate
      myocardial blood flow in patients during endoscopic retrograde
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 patients
      scheduled for ERCP were monitored with a Holter tape recorder and
      underwent myocardial perfusion scintigraphies, to evaluate myocardial
      perfusion at rest and during ERCP. RESULTS: Ten patients completed the
      study. Eight patients had no sign of myocardial ischemia with either of
      the two methods, while two patients developed signs of ischemia during
      ERCP with both the Holter tape recording and on myocardial scintigraphy (P
      = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing ERCP may develop true myocardial
      ischemia with reduced myocardial blood flow. Although this is a
      small-scale study, these findings strongly support the use of alternative
      methods for diagnostic evaluation of the pancreatic duct and biliary tree.

TI  - Neutrophil chemotaxis in bile duct-obstructed rats, and effect of internal
      biliary drainage.
PG  - 918-23
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Our previous studies demonstrated enhanced neutrophil
      chemotaxis in bile duct-ligated, obstructive jaundice rats. In the present
      study, we produced a reversible obstructive jaundice model in rats. The
      efficacy of the present model in producing sufficient bile flow blockade
      and subsequent internal biliary drainage was assessed. Furthermore, the
      effect of internal biliary drainage on neutrophil chemotaxis was
      evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Bile duct was obstructed with a polyester tape
      attached with a stainless steel coil. Internal biliary drainage was
      performed by removing the tape. Rats were subjected to either 10 days'
      bile duct obstruction or 4 days' bile duct obstruction followed by 6 days'
      internal biliary drainage. Some animals underwent conventional bile duct
      ligation and dissection for 4 or 10 days. Neutrophil chemotaxis was
      evaluated with a modified Boyden method using interleukin-8 (recombinant
      rat Gro-beta) as chemoattractant. RESULTS: The present technique produced
      sufficient obstructive jaundice as evidenced by increases in serum alanine
      aminotransferase and total bilirubin throughout the observation period,
      the values of which were insignificant with those induced by the
      conventional method. Internal biliary drainage effectively normalized
      these values. Similarly, neutrophil chemotaxis was enhanced with both
      procedures, and increased neutrophil chemotaxis was significantly
      decreased after drainage. CONCLUSIONS: The present reversible obstructive
      jaundice method is as efficacious as the conventional method for producing
      obstructive jaundice, and internal biliary drainage could be readily
      available. With the present model, neutrophil overactivity in obstructive
      jaundice was effectively alleviated by internal biliary drainage. The
      result may support the role of preoperative biliary drainage in the
      prevention of postoperative septic complications.

TI  - The field comparison of three measuring techniques for evaluation of the
      surface dust level in ventilation ducts.
PG  - 47-54
AB  - This paper reports the comparison of three measuring methods for
      quantifying the amount of dust on the inner surface of ventilation ducts:
      1) a vacuum test method; 2) a gravimetric tape method; and 3) an optical
      method. Thirteen recently constructed buildings were selected for the
      field test in the Helsinki metropolitan area. The dust samples in each
      method were all taken from the same location in the duct. Most of the
      ducts sampled had no residual oil originating from the manufacturing
      process. The mean amount of dust measured with the vacuum test method was
      1.3 g/m2 and the range was < 0.1-8.4 g/m2. The mean surface dust level
      measured using the gravimetric tape method was slightly lower, i.e. 1.2
      g/m2 (< 0.1-5.0 g/m2). The mean cleanliness level of the ducts was 15%
      (2-41%) using the optical method. The wide variations and differences in
      the results of the different methods were caused by the unequal
      distribution of dust on the duct surfaces.

TI  - Analysis of pressure sensitive adhesive tape: I. Evaluation of infrared
      ATR accessory advances
PG  - 93-8
AB  - Attenuated total reflection (ATR), also known as internal reflection
      spectroscopy (IRS), is a forensically accepted method for infrared (IR)
      analysis of pressure sensitive adhesive tapes. Advancements of ATR
      accessories in the last decade have provided the forensic examiner several
      ATR methods to choose from. These accessories offer a variety of ATR
      crystal choices with a variety of prices and capabilities. Four different
      types of pressure sensitive adhesive tapes including duct tape, electrical
      tape, packaging tape and office tape have been used to compare six
      different ATR methods. Each of the methods tested offers both benefits and
      limitaltions which must be considered for the type of sample to be
      analyze. The intent of this paper is to assist the reader in better
      understanding ATR techniques, the many differences among currently
      available ATR accessories and how the method is applied to the analysis of
      pressure sensitive adhesive tape.

TI  - Surgical correction of patent ductus venosus in three brothers.
PG  - 582-9
AB  - We report the presence of a patent ductus venosus in three brothers who
      underwent surgical correction. Patent ductus venosus was demonstrated by
      ultrasonography. Portosystemic venous shunt ratios as evaluated by
      [123I]iodoamphetamine per rectal portal scintigraphy were 67%, 50%, and
      77%, respectively. Histologic examination of liver biopsy specimens
      revealed fatty degeneration in all cases. Portal vein pressure before and
      after temporarily occluding the patent ductus venosus was estimated by an
      Anthron P-U catheter introduced into the portal vein via the ligament
      teres hepatis. Portal venous pressure increased from 10 to 17 cm H2O, 16
      to 23 cm H2O, and 14 to 27 cm H2O, respectively. Therefore, banding of the
      ductus venosus with Teflon tape was attempted to prevent portal
      hypertension following complete ligation. As a result, portal venous
      pressures after stricture of the ductus venosus were 12, 21, and 20 cm
      H2), respectively. Bile acid and liver enzymes decreased and returned to
      normal within 14 days after surgery. Interestingly, serum concentrations
      of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) increased significantly after
      restoration of the portal blood flow and then gradually decreased, but
      remained persistently elevated for at least two weeks in two cases
      measured after surgical correction. One month after correction, liver
      function returned to normal as assessed by serological and histological
      parameters in all cases. These results suggest that it is important to
      determine whether stricture or complete ligation is indicated for a patent
      ductus venosus during surgical correction, based on the portal venous
      pressure after temporal test occlusion of the duct. In addition, HGF may
      be a useful marker for normalization of hepatic microcirculation after
      surgery.

TI  - Fixation-induced shrinkage of Reissner's membrane and its potential
      influence on the assessment of endolymph volume.
PG  - 62-8
AB  - The quantification of endolymph volume by histological techniques or by
      magnetic resonance (MR) microscopy requires the inner ear to be first
      treated with chemical fixatives. If the fixative induces soft-tissue
      shrinkage, it would tend to return a distended Reissner's membrane towards
      a straight position, since this membrane is anchored to bone at its medial
      and lateral edges. The goal of this study was to determine the degree of
      Reissner's membrane shrinkage induced by different fixation protocols to
      establish methods which minimize tissue shrinkage. Fragments of fresh
      Reissner's membrane were dissected from isolated cochleae in an artificial
      perilymph. Specimens were viewed with an inverted microscope during
      infusion of fixatives, and changes recorded on video tape. Size changes of
      the specimen were quantified, usually over a 20 min period.
      Heidenhain-Susa, a fixative which is widely used in histological studies
      of hydropic cochleae, caused substantial shrinkage of Reissner's membrane,
      decreasing the length of specimens by an average of 15.1%. Other fixation
      procedures induced far less shrinkage. The use of 3.1% glutaraldehyde in
      Hanks' balanced salt solution produced a mean length decrease of only
      0.3%. The inclusion in the fixation medium of 4.5% mercuric chloride,
      corresponding to the concentration which is present in Heidenhain-Susa and
      which acts to increase the contrast of Reissner's membrane in MR
      microscopy, contributes significantly to specimen shrinkage. We can
      conclude that the degree of endolymphatic hydrops may be underestimated in
      specimens fixed with media containing high levels of mercuric chloride.

TI  - A new technique for exposing Calot's triangle during laparoscopic surgery:
      usefulness of extracorporeal lifting of the round ligament and
      gallbladder.
PG  - 307-9
AB  - We developed a maneuver for holding and lifting the intraperitoneal organs
      from the extracorporeal side using a new instrument, the leading bar, by
      which we could guide the tape or the thread to the outside of the abdomen.
      In the case of cholecystolithiasis with a thickened wall or a stone stuck
      in the neck, we lifted the round ligament and gallbladder for better
      exposure of Calot's triangle, using the tape or thread through the
      abdominal wall to the extracorporeal side, and then clamped them with
      Kocher's forceps. With this technique, a good view of Calot's triangle was
      maintained so that the surgeon could expose the cystic duct easily and
      safely using both hands.

TI  - Intra-operative and postoperative biliary endoscopy (choledochoscopy). The
      role of the surgeons.
PG  - 267-72
AB  - Intra-operative and postoperative choledochoscopy is an important adjunct
      to biliary surgery. In the last two decades, the necessity of this
      examination became obvious but two surveys clearly indicated that despite
      the availability of instruments surgeons do not use it routinely. One of
      the reasons is the long learning curve and the limited experience. The
      introduction of the video choledochoscope opened a new chapter because the
      surgeon could learn it faster and the technique is easier to use.
      Choledochoscopy is a "two man" job, requiring four hands. Using video
      choledochoscopy, the assistant and the operator can observe the situation
      together, therefore coordination of movement is easier. The actual
      endoscopic procedure is faster and the location of the stone, its removal,
      and the sphincter function are recorded on tape. This is a great step
      forward in analyzing sphincter function. It became the method of choice in
      teaching. It is assumed that, with the introduction of video
      choledochoscopy, the incidence of missed stones will be decreased
      significantly.

TI  - Induction of nesidioblastosis will reverse diabetes in Syrian golden
      hamster.
PG  - 334-41
AB  - Nesidioblastosis, which is the formation of new islets and the
      differentiation of cells within the islets, represents part of the
      spectrum of hyperfunctioning states of the islets of Langerhans at the
      clinical level. Nesidioblastosis in the Syrian golden hamster can be
      induced by wrapping the head of the pancreas with cellophane tape.
      Ligation of the duct is not involved, and acinar cell atrophy does not
      occur. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the induction of
      nesidioblastosis could be used as a means of reversing
      streptozocin-induced diabetes. Outbred hamsters (n = 32), 8 wk of age,
      were rendered diabetic by treatment with 40 mg/kg i.p. streptozocin,
      administered daily for 3 days. Four days later, 16 animals chosen at
      random underwent laparotomy with cellophane wrapping of the pancreas.
      Before surgery, the serum glucose and insulin levels (means +/- SE) in the
      unoperated control animals (389.0 +/- 18.6, 33.9 +/- 3.8) did not differ
      from those in the animals awaiting the operation (373.2 +/- 18.6, 37.9 +/-
      3.8). After 7 wk, 50% of the operated animals had serum glucose and
      insulin levels that were normal, compared to only 12% of the unoperated
      control animals (chi2 = 5.53, P less than .05). Islets from normoglycemic
      operated animals were characterized by increased numbers, including many
      small islets, positive immunoreactive insulin staining, and minimal
      vacuolation of cells. Islets from hyperglycemic operated hamsters and from
      the unoperated control animals were decreased in number and generally
      larger in size, demonstrated little or no immunoreactive insulin staining,
      and exhibited marked vacuolation of cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

TI  - Chylopericardium following cardiac surgery.
PG  - 542-3
AB  - Chylopericardium is one of the rarest complications of cardiac surgery.
      The authors report only the 19th case, that of a 12-year-old boy. The
      chylopericardium developed after an aortic valvotomy, even though the
      retropericardial portion of the mediastinum was entered only to pass a
      tape around the ascending aorta. Etiologic factors are directly or
      indirectly related to injury to the thoracic duct or tis tributaries.
      Treatment initially is conservative, consisting of adequate pericardial
      drainage and a low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diet. If this fails, the
      appropriate operative procedure is carried out.

TI  - Development of experimental cancer in the head of the pancreas by surgical
      induction of tissue injury.
PG  - 146-51
AB  - The majority of carcinomas of the pancreas in humans are of ductal origin
      and are located in the head of the gland. These clinical characteristics
      however, are not affected in traditional animal models of the disease.
      Partial pancreatic duct obstruction with ductal epithelial hyperplasia was
      produced in the Syrian golden hamster by wrapping the head of the pancreas
      with cellophane tape. Wrapped and unwrapped animals were then exposed to
      an exogenous carcinogen (N-nitrosobis[2-oxopropyl]amine). Assay of serum
      ribonuclease activity was used as a marker of disease. Invasive lesions
      developed in both groups of animals. Fifty percent of the tumors in the
      Group II (cellophane wrap and N-nitrosobis [2-oxopropyl] amine) hamsters
      were located in the head of the gland and were of ductal origin. All
      tumors in animals receiving N-nitrosobis [2-oxopropyl]amine alone (Group
      I) occurred peripherally and were derived from ductular or acinar tissue.
      Elevation of serum ribonuclease activity was noted early in the course of
      carcinogenesis, thereafter returning to normal, which may explain the
      clinical controversy regarding this marker. This new model should enhance
      our knowledge of the interrelationships between etiologic factors,
      precursor lesions, and pancreatic cancer.

TI  - A new approach to the induction of duct epithelial hyperplasia and
      nesidioblastosis by cellophane wrapping of the hamster pancreas.
PG  - 63-72
AB  - There is ample evidence that a relationship exists between duct epithelial
      hyperplasia and carcinoma of the pancreas. However, no experimental system
      exists to investigate the mechanisms involved. A new model is described in
      the Syrian golden hamster for inducing duct epithelial hyperplasia and
      nesidioblastosis. The head of the pancreas is wrapped with cellophane
      tape; ligation of the duct is not involved and there is no evidence of
      diffuse pancreatitis. Preliminary studies have revealed that this model
      results in periductal fibrosis in relation to the cellophane thus
      producing partial duct obstruction. Concomitant with the fibrosis there is
      duct epithelial hyperplasia in the head of the gland, while peripherally
      there is ductular proliferation and the initiation of nesidioblastosis. It
      is believed that this model will be of use in studies of pancreatic
      carcinogenesis and will thus enhance our knowledge of the
      interrelationships between etiologic factors, precursor lesions, and
      pancreatic cancer. This is of particular importance in the early
      recognition of this neoplasm in man.

TI  - New methods used to investigate the control of mucus secretion and ion
      transport in airways.
PG  - 121-30
AB  - Our group developed two in vivo methods to study secretions from
      submucosal glands in exposed tracheal epithelium. (1) The exposed mucosal
      surface was coated with powdered tantalum; accumulated secretions produced
      elevations (hillocks) in the tantalum layer under which the duct openings
      were located. The rate of formation of the hillocks was observed through a
      dissecting microscope, and recorded by television on a video tape
      recorder. (2) Micropipets were used to collect timed samples from
      individual gland duct openings. With these techniques, the innervation of
      the submucosal glands and the autonomic regulation of their secretions
      were studied. We studied the control of ion movement across tracheal
      epithelium because active ion transport forms local osmotic gradients
      across epithelia which could regulate transepithelial water movement. We
      mounted pieces of the posterior wall of dog trachea in Ussing-type
      chambers and measured unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ under
      short-circuit conditions with 36Cl and 24Na. We found active transport of
      Cl- toward the lumen and Na+ toward the submucosa. With this technique we
      investigated the effect of parasympathomimetic drugs on ion movement. With
      a new in vitro method we studied output of 35S bound to sulfated mucins
      and movement of ions in cat trachea. We mounted pieces of anterior
      tracheal wall in Ussing-type chambers, added sodium 35S-sulfate to the
      submucosal side and monitored secretion of bound 35S in samples from the
      luminal side after dialysis. The unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ were
      measured with 36Cl and 22Na. With this method we examined the effect of
      alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic agonists on mucin secretion and ion
      movement. Also with this preparation we studied the relationship between
      the permeability of the paracellular pathway to 14C-sucrose and the
      pattern of tight junction strands.

TI  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus: a light and electron
      microscopic study.
PG  - 1516-25
AB  - The light and electron microscopic appearances of adenoid cystic carcinoma
      of the esophagus are presented. Typical light microscopic features of
      adenoid cystic carcinoma were seen, but a unique additional feature was
      the presence at one edge of the tumor of gland-like structures lined
      entirely by tumor cells and opening onto an intact esophageal epithelium.
      Electron microscopy showed cystic spaces containing replicated basement
      membrane surrounded by epithelial cells with occasional myoepithelial
      cells at the interface. Rare lumina were seen between the cells with
      microvilli projecting into them. Occasional epithelial cells contained
      granules of neurosecretory tape. Both the light and electron microscopic
      findings strongly support an origin from the intercalated duct of
      esophageal mucus glands. The paucity of gland lumina may represent a
      lesser degree of differentiation which would accord well with the known
      biological aggressiveness of the tumor at this site.

TI  - Conjunctival transport of technetium-99m pertechnetate.
PG  - 691-9
AB  - Using a gamma camera coupled to a computer and a tape unit the transport
      of pertechnetate (Tc99m) across the conjunctiva was determined by the
      'region of interest' technique in human subjects. In 11 patients with
      their lacrimal sacs removed a fractional turnover rate of 0.021 min-1 was
      found. In 21 patients with inflammed conjunctiva due to chronic
      dacryocystitis a fractional turnover rate of 0.027 min-1 was found,
      whereas the value in 11 normal individuals was 0.015 min-1. Neglecting the
      relatively small transcorneal route of disappearance, the values found for
      technetium disappearance could be regarded as representative for the
      transconjunctival transport of the radioisotope. This assumption was
      confirmed by correlating the radioactivity in the blood with the
      fractional turnover rate.

TI  - [Effects of chronic and progressive obstruction of the main pancreatic
      duct on the epithelium of the ducts and the exocrine pancreatic tissue]
PG  - 548-52
AB  - The alarming increase in the number of clinical cases of carcinoma of the
      pancreas provides the stimulation to search for an experimental model that
      produces chronic progressive obstruction of the main pancreatic duct.
      Fifteen mongrel dogs were studied for 1 to 11 weeks. To induce chronic
      progressive obstruction of the pancreatic duct, a cellophane tape was
      placed around the main duct adjacent to its entrance into the duodenum and
      tied over a needle with a diameter identical to that of the duct; the
      needle was then withdrawn. All minor ducts were identified by
      pancreatography and then ligated with 2-0 silk. Each animal was followed
      up by repeated ductal pancreatography and measurements of serum amylase
      and alkaline phosphatase concentrations. Histologic, histochemical and
      ultrastructural studies were also performed. On both gross and microscopic
      examination each animal demonstrated chronic pancreatitis with
      preservation of the islands of Langerhans. In the early period (4 to 7
      days) complete ductal obstruction occurred as demonstrated by
      pancreatography and by elevated serum values for amylase (264% increase)
      and alkaline phosphatase (209% increase). In contrast to what is seen
      after acute ductal ligation, the ductal epithelial cells increased in
      number and height. At 4 weeks a new collateral ductal system had developed
      and serum amylase and alkaline phosphatase values had reverted to normal.
      This model is useful in studying the kinetics of pancreatic ductal
      regeneration and the pathophysiology associated with chronic pancreatic
      ductal obstruction.

TI  - Trypan blue accumulation in the embryonic gut of rats and mice during the
      teratogenic phase.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - Four to 48 hours after iv and sc administration of teratogenic doses of
      trypan blue to rats and mice the uterus was removed and rapidly frozen,
      after having been placed in a horizontal plane, and frozen sections were
      attached to tape and dried at a low temperature. By this procedure embryos
      and placental structures were present in the same sections and loss or
      redistribution of the dye was minimized. The dye was found in the yolk-sac
      cavity and to be accumulated in the visceral (proximal) endoderm. It was
      also acculmulated in the embryonic endoderm--forming the embryonic gut.
      This accumulation occurred after the administration of the trypan blue up
      to the time of closure of the vitelline duct, which occurs at 11 days
      postconception in rats and 9.5 days in mice. None was found when injection
      was made after this closure. No dye was detected in the ecto- and
      mesodermal layers. The period of embryonic uptake of trypan blue largely
      corresponds with the period of teratogenic sensitivity in these species as
      reported by others.

TI  - [Rearing and management of chimpanzees for experimental infection with
      hepatitis B virus (author's transl)]
PG  - 51-64
AB  - For the purpose of experimental infection with human hepatitis B virus, 14
      chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) were delivered to the Division of Animal
      Research, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo. These chimps,
      11 males and 3 females, born in the West Africa, had been reared for two
      to six months. Several days after delivery, they were anesthetized with
      Ketalar in order to make clinical, bacteriological and parasitological
      examinations; It was found that one of them was in malnutrition, and that
      another had dislocation of the shoulder joint and the associating abscess.
      All of them were negative for tuberculin test. In the bacteriological
      examination, Shigella sonnei was detected in the feces from one of them.
      Mycoplasma sp. was detected in the materials from the oral cavity of four
      head. As intestinal parasites, Ascaris sp. were detected in two head,
      Enterobius vermicularis in eight, Strongloides sp. in two, Oesophagostomum
      sp. in nine, tape worms in four, and Entamoeba coli in twelve.
      Microfilaria as blood parasite was detected in 11 of them. The laboratory
      used for the experimental infection was a room occupying about 42 m2,
      which had been built by renovating a part of our division building. Each
      of the cages used for rearing the chimps was contained in the isolation
      box made of stainless steel. The contaminated air in the isolation box was
      discharged forcedly into the exhausting duct with a fan, and further
      passed through the HEPA filter and the Miraceram honeycomb heater, and was
      then conducted to the already existing ventilation duct of the division
      building. Each chimp was fed on a ration of 200-350 g of the imported
      "Purina Monkey Chow 25" and also one grapefruit and one banana daily for
      the supply of vitamin C. The chimps weighed 16.1 kg on the average on
      delivery, but gained an average weight of 4.2 kg during the following four
      months.
