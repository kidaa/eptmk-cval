RELEASE: 2006_11_2...

The source code was substantially reorganized, and a C++ class library is now
provided with examples. An improved sentence segmentation algorithm is included.

The lexicon now contains an expanded list of multi-word lexical items, including verbs.
The lexicon entries for some of the most frequent verbs were modified to improve their
tagging accuracy.

The annotations of the corpus (the ".ioc" files in the tagged subdirectory) were modified,
the majority of the changes related to tagging of multi-word lexical items, which now include
some verbs.

The name of the file INSTALL.medpost was changed to INSTALL.
