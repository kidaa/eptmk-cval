Medpost corpus & tagger

Downloaded from:

I tried other versions (like the sourceforge one) and I couldn't compile
them or didn't work. This one works.

To install:
- make dir and copy distribution file inside.
$ gunzip medpost.tar.gz
$ tar xf medpost.tar
$ make

To transform tagset to Penn Treebank:
perl MEDPOST_PATH/util/medpost2tag.perl -penn -preserve [file...]

Last command is used on *.ioc files inside tagged/ dir. It sends the
translation to Penn Treebank tagset of the file to stdout. Therefore, redirect
the stdout of the command to another file to save the results.
For an example, look at trans2tbank.bash script in this directory.
